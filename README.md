# DOTFILES

Hi! Here are my dotfiles.

## My Use Case
I am using mainly Vim if I want to write something short in Latex, SQL, Shell,
Java, Clojure or even Haskell. For bigger things I like to use a modern IDE with 
a VIM Plugin.

## What am I using?
* Vim 
* Vundle
* tmux
* zsh
* zprezto
* xrdr (xrandr wrapper)
* things in my i3
* of course i3
* and a lot of other funny stuff :)
