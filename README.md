# DOTFILES

Hi! Here are my dotfiles and these are 'managed' with GNU Stow.

## How to install the scripts?

If you want to use my i3 config for example then just `stow i3wm` inside the
*project root*. This will create a symlink to `~/.config/i3`

## What am I using?

Here is a list of some programs I use mostly with links to the project.

* [NeoVim](https://www.neovim.io)
