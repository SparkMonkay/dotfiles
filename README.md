# DOTFILES

Hi! Here are my dotfiles and these are 'managed' with GNU Stow.

## How to install the scripts?

If you want to use my i3 config for example then just `stow i3wm` inside the
*project root*. This will create a symlink to `~/.config/i3`

## What am I using?

Here is a list of some programs I use mostly with links to the project.

* [NeoVim](https://www.neovim.io)
* [VimPlug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
* [byobu](https://byobu.org) - (basically still tmux but nearly zero config)
* [zsh](https://www.zsh.org)
* [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug)
* [i3wm](https://github.com/i3/i3) - no, I don't use gaps because this is wasted screen space
* [i3blocks (my fork)](https://github.com/zeljkobekcic/i3blocks)
* [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) - to manage my dotfiles
* [maim](https://github.com/naelstrof/maim) - to make screenshots (uses `xdotool`)
* [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
* [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
* [feh](https://feh.finalrewind.org/)

## What I am not using anymore/currently

Here are some programs/scripts whatever I am not using anymore or at the
moment because of reason. Like they were not usable enough or I found better
alternatives.

* [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/)
* [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
* [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezt)
* [xrdr](https://github.com/pschmitt/xrdr)
* [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org) 
* [st](https://st.suckless.org)
* [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) 
* [todo.txt-cli](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli) 

## You have an interesting/cool program I should give a try?

I am always happy to try new stuff. If you think that something is really worth
giving a shot mail me (see my profile)
